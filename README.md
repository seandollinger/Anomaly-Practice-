Isolation Forest Anomaly Detection
Overview
This script demonstrates how to use the Isolation Forest algorithm to detect anomalies in a dataset. The Isolation Forest is an unsupervised learning algorithm particularly well-suited for identifying outliers or anomalous data points in high-dimensional datasets.

Requirements
To run this script, you need the following Python libraries:

numpy
matplotlib
scikit-learn
You can install these packages using pip:

bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
Code Explanation
1. Importing Libraries
The necessary libraries are imported at the beginning of the script:

python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest
 
2. Generating Sample Data
The data used in this example is generated using a normal distribution. The data is then reshaped to fit the input format required by the Isolation Forest model:

python
data = np.random.normal(scale=0.5, size=1000)
data = data.reshape(-1, 1)
3. Initializing the Isolation Forest Model
The Isolation Forest model is initialized with a contamination parameter, which represents the proportion of outliers in the dataset. In this example, the contamination is set to 0.5 (5%):

python
clf = IsolationForest(contamination=0.05)
4. Fitting the Model and Predicting Anomalies
The model is fitted to the data, and predictions are made to identify anomalies:

python
predictions = clf.fit_predict(data)
In the predictions, anomalies are labeled as -1, and normal data points are labeled as 1.

5. Identifying Anomalous Data Points
The indices of the anomalous data points are extracted using the following code:

python
anomoly_indices = np.where(predictions == -1)[0]
6. Visualizing the Results
The data is visualized using matplotlib. The normal data points are plotted as a line, and the anomalies are highlighted using red scatter points:

python
plt.plot(range(len(data)), data)
plt.scatter(anomoly_indices, data[anomoly_indices], c='r')
plt.show()
 
 
Ensure you have the required packages installed.
Copy the script into a Python file, e.g., isolation_forest_example.py.
Run the script:
bash

python isolation_forest_example.py
The script will generate a plot displaying the dataset with anomalies highlighted in red.

Conclusion
This example demonstrates how to use the Isolation Forest algorithm to detect outliers in a dataset. The script is a simple introduction to anomaly detection with Isolation Forest and can be adapted to more complex datasets and use cases.
